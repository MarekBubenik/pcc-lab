## 🔧 About

I run a self-hosted homelab powered by **Proxmox** as the virtualization platform, hosting multiple Linux VMs and containers. I use **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for containerization and orchestration, allowing me to simulate production-like deployments. **Ansible** handles configuration management and automation across systems. Still dipping my feet with these technologies in my lab as well as in work. Would like to incorporate **OpenTofu** for infrastructure as code and **Python** for scripting and automation in a near future. 

It's my personal playground for **learning, testing, and building real-world scenarios in a controlled environment**. 🙏🏼
